# project-board
This is a project board that provides a visual display to keep track of my current projects' tasks and their individual statuses.

You can visit the site [here](https://danielcoombs005.github.io/project-board/index.html).

(Please note that this project is for display purposes only. I plan to create a separate repository for editing the JSON file through the site, but I only plan for this to occur locally. Hosting a website to do this safely would require an API to handle user verification as well as a database integration to store the data, both of which would require further effort. However, if I am able to set up a free server for both an API and database, I will update this project to allow for user handling so that I can update the projects on the live website).
